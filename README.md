# Train Catcher

An open source Android application which tracks the 
MBTA red, blue, green, and orange lines in realtime. 
The application utilizes MBTA's json feed for live 
tracking of trains and the GTFS speced protobuf feed 
to list <i>all</i> train station etas.

# Goal

To demonstrate the usage of both types of feeds from the Mass Bay Transit Authority in Android. 
The application is built using material best practices.
